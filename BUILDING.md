## ðŸš€ Building Guide

Required Tools:

-   Git: https://git-scm.com/
-   Package manager: [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) or [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) or [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
-   Astro: https://astro.build/

1.  **Clone the Repository.**

    Use the git CLI to clone this repository

    ```shell
    # clone this project's source
    git clone https://github.com/sonicjhon1/strato-website.git
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into the site's directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd strato-website/
    # repacle "bun" with your package manager
    bun install
    bun run dev
    ```

3.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

    Your site is now running at localhost:4321!

    Edit `src/pages/index.astro` to see your site update in real-time!

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ icons/strato-logo.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Navbar.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |

| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
